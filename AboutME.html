	  <p>I’m Juseung Lee, a senior majoring in Computer Science at IIT. I like seafood, especially sashimi, and I usually enjoy going to art galleries and museums in my free time. Since I was young, I have traveled around the world as well as my home country, South Korea, with my family. Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, it is currently challenging to travel around the world. I hope the day when I can travel will come soon.
